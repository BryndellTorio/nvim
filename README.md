# Nvim Configuration Notes

## Bug fixed
+ Refactoring nvim config to fix go to definitions of nvim.
    - The bug is now **fixed**. ***Config***  is more organized. I am loving the experience so far.
+ Ensure marksman has been installed locally. 
    - Mason installation will still rely into a marksman.exe which is in local $PATH.

## Addons in the near future
+ Zenmode will make the coding environment more focus oriented.
